### Javascript

- when unchecking a specific console, uncheck the console group
    - optimize that so the same code applies to all checkbox groups
- every checkbox checked goes into an array in two categories (consoles and genres) and with a button validate and show only checked

### CSS

- make everything pretty

### Content

- square image for every game
- info over image
- define games genres
- find a name for the service
