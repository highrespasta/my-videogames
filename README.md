# Nyx's games collection

Trying to have a website where i list all the physical games i own and be able to order and categorise them, then eventually implement a back-end where my friends can borrow them.

## Todo List v1.0

### Javascript

- multi-level sorting system

#### sorting behavior
- when nothing is selected, show everything
- when selecting consoles and genres, show:
    - games of any selected console AND of any selected genre
        -  example if you select PS2 and PS4 and RPG and FPS:
            - show all PS2 and PS4 games that are either RPG or FPS
    - ability for games to have multiple genres

Optional:
- sort by PEGI rating
- sort by availability
- sort by recommended (by me)

### CSS

- make everything pretty
- mobile friendly

### Content

- square image for every game
- minimal info hover image
    - more info opens on click
- define games genres
- find a name for the service
